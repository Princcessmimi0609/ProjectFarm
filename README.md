# ProjectFarm
A small farm located between Edinburgh and Carlisle has been converted to a visitor  attraction that includes a shop selling local produce and plants, small petting zoo, cafe, Play  Park and walks. The owner requires a website to help promote the business both locally and to tourists,  passing trade and day trippers.   Initially they want to advertise the location, opening times, goods and services. Their aim is  to appeal to a wide target audience including families, garden enthusiasts, travellers looking  for a quality place to stop etc. They would like the website to look fun but professional, be easy to use and work on all  modern browsers.
